    <h2>Food1: Oats</h2>
    <p>Oat groats, the most intact and whole form of oats, take a long time to cook. For this reason, most people prefer
        rolled, crushed, or steel-cut oats.
        Instant (quick) oats are the most highly processed variety. While they take the shortest time to cook, the
        texture may be mushy.<br>
        Oats are commonly eaten for breakfast as oatmeal, which is made by boiling oats in water or milk. Oatmeal is
        often referred to as porridge.<br>
        Theyâ€™re also often included in muffins, granola bars, cookies, and other baked good</p>
